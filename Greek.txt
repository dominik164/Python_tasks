The smooth breathing (Ancient Greek:     psil n pne ma; Modern Greek:   psil ; Latin: sp ritus l nis) is a diacritical mark used in polytonic orthography. In ancient Greek, it marks the absence of the voiceless glottal fricative /h/ from the beginning of a word.
Some authorities have interpreted it as representing a glottal stop, but a final vowel at the end of a word is regularly elided (removed) where the following word starts with a vowel   and elision would not happen if the second word began with a glottal stop (or any form of stop consonant). In his Vox Graeca, W. Sidney Allen accordingly regards the glottal stop interpretation as "highly improbable".
The smooth breathing (   ) is written as on top of one initial vowel, on top of the second vowel of a diphthong, or to the left of a capital, and also in certain editions on the first of a pair of rhos. It did not occur on an initial upsilon, which always has rough breathing (thus the early name   hy, rather than   y).
The smooth breathing was kept in the traditional polytonic orthography even after the /h/ sound had disappeared from the language in Hellenistic times. It has been dropped in the modern monotonic orthography.
